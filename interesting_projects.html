									<p>A game that was made in collaboration with two other teammates as we worked through the challenge of creating a game in JavaScript which included procedurally generated video and audio to keep the size of the game under 1mb. We accomplished this all while managing a production timeline which included storyboarding, prototyping, task delegation, and weekly progress reports. The entire project was made in two weeks. More project specifications can be found in the README in the GitHub Repository.</p>

									<p>Using a self-trained neural network based off Kaggle dataset of faces allows. The user can play Tic Tac Toe using facial expressions to select where to play. The neural network employs convolution layers, maxpooling layers, dense layers, dropout layers, and data augmentation to minimize overfitting to the relatively small data set.</p>

									</header>
									<a  class="image fit" href="https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/Huffman-Encoding-Decoding" target = "_blank"><img src="images/C_Programming_Language.png" alt=""  /></a>
									<p>A C program that compresses and decompresses files using Huffman encoding. The biggest challenge that I encountered was making each data structure robust. I had to be certain that they would handle every case accurately so when I added data structures that depended on it, I would be able to easily debug and find the source of any issues. I also found it quite interesting to be able to create functions that would allow me to read and write singular bits. All the datastructures used were created by myself.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/RSA-Encryption-Decryption" target = "_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/RSA_Logo.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A C program that encrypts, decrypts, and generates public/private keys using RSA algorithms. Just like the Huffman Encoding, I had to make sure that each underlying data structure was robust so I could easily debug. However, I found that the hardest part was figuring out how to use the GNU Bignum MPZ library. I was not used to using it so it was a challenge to discover and learn all the different possibilities I had access to with the library. All the datastructures used were created by myself.</p>

										<h2>My Personal Computer</h2>

									<img class="image fit" src="images/Personal-Computer.jpg" alt="" />
									<p>My personal computer is an ongoing project that I originally built over 10 years ago and continued to work on and upgrade ever since. I’ve troubleshot and fixed all sorts of issues which has given me a large amount of knowledge and practice with computer building. I keep the stickers of new and replacement parts as I get them to serve as reminders of the progress I have made over the years.</p>

									<a href="https://wyatt-hawes.itch.io/doyoumindbugs" target = "_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/Title Screen (more bugs).png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A small game made with a couple of friends as a group using the free version of the Construct 3 creation engine and then hosted on Itch.io. The biggest challenge was managing the restrictions imposed by the free version of Construct that severely limits the functionality of the engine. This essentially only gave us 50 "if statements" to create a game with. Despite this, we were able to make a game with cutscenes, different weapons, enemies, and a boss!</p>

										<h2>Battleship Board Game</h2>
									</header>
									<img class="image fit" src="images/Battleship.png"/>
									<p>A board game where I cut and painted the ships, board, and islands by hand. It was a challenge to accurately depict the digital gameplay experience of the popular warship battling game into a physical board game. I believe I was able to accurately portray ship customization, strategy, ship speed, maneuvering, modular damage, and visibility in a physical form. I found that the most challenging aspect was efficiently managing my time so I could create all the essential pieces for the game in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
